# Kaggle-

### Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.


[Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Kaggle-and-how-exactly-should-I-use-it)

Kaggle is platform to compete with others in competitions which are based on machine learning tasks. You may know about Codechef, Hackerrank etc., so kaggle is also like them, but the key difference is the competition are only related to machine learning, data science, Deep learning or AI related. Most of time you have been given some training and testing dataset to build some good machine learning models and when you public your kernel , others will review it and then gives you upvotes just like Quora.

## How you can use it?

Well using Kaggle is really good thing for learning some trends and techniques in machine learning or data science. If you are really good in data science then I would suggest you to take part in competition. You will find dozens of them on Kaggle. If you are not really good in data science then you should use Kaggle for learning purpose. You can read blogs, interviews of grand masters and winners of different competitions. You can read articles related to some techniques in data science. And when you get comfortable with data science then go to competition section and take part in competition.
